Purpose:
This specification gives designers, developers, DevOps, QA, and compliance teams a **single, measurable contract** for the entire app-lifecycle on storefront devices. By defining what “good” looks like for installation, over-the-air updates, and full removal, we eliminate ambiguity, shorten release cycles, and ensure that SelfFull never breaks a user’s device storage, privacy expectations, or productivity flow. The document also provides auditors with concrete evidence that SelfFull complies with Google Play Core, Apple App Store, and platform data-retention rules from day one. Ultimately, it protects our brand and users while saving the company time and money.

Steps:

1. Install SelfFull from App Store

   Searching “SelfFull” in the App Store or Play Store returns the official listing within the first five results, showing the correct publisher “SelfFull, Inc.”, icon, and version tag.

   App installs cleanly on **iOS 14 + / iPadOS 14 + / macOS 11 + (M-series)** and **Android 8.0 (API 26)+** reference devices.
